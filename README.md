## About Me

I am passionate about Data workflows, Data Efficiency, Data Transformation and Visualization. Even though my core career is Finance, what keeps me busy in my free time is a growing interest in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and ML Ops.

## Portfolio Highlights
### The following are the main projects that I worked on during the **MIT - Applied Data Science certificate**

### Project 1: Used car price prediction

- **Description:** The Indian market currently has a high demand for used cars. A tech start-up aims to capitalize on this trend. The shift in demand towards the pre-owned market is evident, with some car owners choosing to replace their old vehicles with used cars instead of buying new ones. The pricing and supply of used cars are uncertain and influenced by factors such as mileage, brand, model, and year. Setting the correct price for a used car is challenging for sellers, making an effective pricing model crucial for success in the market.

- **Technologies Used:** Decision Trees | Random Forest | Linear Regression | Hyperparameter Tunning | Exploratory Data Analysis

- **GitHub Repository:** [Used Car Price Prediction Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AndresGVW/CarPricePrediction)

### Project 2: Boston House Price Prediction

- **Description:** This project involves predicting house prices in the Boston metropolitan area based on the features of the property and its locality using regression techniques.

- **Technologies Used:** Exploratory Data Analysis | Visualization | Multicollinearity | Linear Regression | Regression Techniques

- **GitHub Repository:** [Boston House Price Prediction Jupyter Noebook](https://github.com/AndresGVW/BostonHousePricePrediction)

### Project 3: FoodHub Order Analysis

- **Description:** A food aggregator company in New York offers access to multiple restaurants through a smartphone app. The data provides different features for each order. I performed univariate and multivariate exploratory data analysis to identify the most valuable correlation to revenue, including preparations and delivery time, popularity, cost/profit ratio and client ratings.

- **Technologies Used:** Exploratory Data Analysis | Visualization | Statistics
